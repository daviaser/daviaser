### Hi, I'm Davia ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!!
I am an ambitious coding enthusiast who is eager to learn about all things code.
As I progress and develop my coding skills, I would like to gradually add more projects as to represent "my coding blog/journey".

I am currently a second year Computer Science major whose career goal is to be a software engineer or front-end engineer in web and app development. So far, the languages and platforms that I have become knowledgeable in/familiar with are Python, Java, Dart(Flutter), SQL, VS Code, Tableau and React. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects to strengthen my coding skills and develop new ones.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, PHP, C++, API design techniques and Cloud computing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with developers and software structured businesses/companies by working on projects possibly through interships so that I can gain real world working experiences to sharpen and acquire new and existing skills needed to get to my desired career path.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love travelling and learning about different cultures and would love to visit every country in the world someday!!
